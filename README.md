The Code gives you an example of my Kaggle Competition Submission which got me under the Top 20%.
It is a short example of various Machine Learning Regression Techniques combined to an Averaged Model.
I was testing many combinations of ensemble models containing the LassoCV, RidgeCV, ElasticNetCV, KernelRidge, GradientBoostingRegression and some more, finding out that for me the ensemble of  LassoCV and GradientBosstingRegression worked out the best.
