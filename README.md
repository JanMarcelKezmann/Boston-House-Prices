The Code gives you an example of my Kaggle Competition Submission which got me under the Top 20%.
It is a short example of various Machine Learning Regression Techniques combined to an Averaged Model.
<p>I was testing many combinations of ensemble models containing the <strong>LassoCV, RidgeCV, ElasticNetCV, KernelRidge, GradientBoostingRegression</strong> and some more not shown in the code, finding out that for me the ensemble of LassoCV and GradientBosstingRegression worked out the best.</p>
